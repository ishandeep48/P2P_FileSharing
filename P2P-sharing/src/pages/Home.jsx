            <h3>This is a Server Aided Peer to Peer File Sharing Website. The Transfer Rate of the files 
                depends on your network connection not on the Server . The Server can be bad but your transfer 
                rate will still be amazing if you have good connection. I made this as a fun side kinda project just 
                to share files with my friends in my college hostel .......................      ( also i dont know what else to make )
